# Bionic Arm Using Arduino

## Overview
This project is a DIY bionic arm built using Arduino and servo motors.
The arm mimics basic hand movements by controlling multiple servos.

## Components Used
- Arduino Uno 
- Servo Motors
- Jumper Wires
- External Power Supply
- PVC plastic body structure

## Working Principle
Each servo motor is connected to a joint of the arm.
By sending angle values from the Arduino, the servos rotate and
produce hand-like movements.

## Features
- Individual finger control
- Smooth servo movement
- Low-cost and beginner-friendly design

## Challenges Faced
- Servo jitter due to power issues  
- Incorrect angle mapping  

## Solutions
- Used external power supply
- Calibrated servo angles manually

## Future Improvements
- Gesture control
- Wi-Fi or Bluetooth control
- Voice control
- More precise
